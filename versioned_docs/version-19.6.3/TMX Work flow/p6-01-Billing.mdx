You can create a bill for an assignee or a project by choosing the "new bill" option. 

The billing module is available in list and detail views. 

The bill number, person's name, and the status of the bill are all displayed in the detail view. 

Information like project details, payment status, person to pay, bill amount, and balance due are all provided in the list view.

The payments for the assignees services or projects must be made after the PM has authorized the completed file.

When the accounting department completes the payment, the PM must update the pending payment status to paid payment status in the detail view, which also updates the outstanding amount to zero. 

You can select to download, print, and email the bill for the accounts department in order to maintain track of payments.
