In this module you can add **new assignees**, their details, employee type as well as the languages and services they will provide. 

The data is displayed on the assignees page in list and detail views. 

The list view displays a list of assignees, language, employee type, login rights with Email. 

The detailed view shows the specifications of each chosen assignee along with details on the services they will be involved in.

There are different roles assigned in **TMX**, and each position has a unique set of access privileges.

When creating a login credential, in the account Info section you can indicate the user's privileges, to have access to TMX as a Project Manager, Team Leader, Content Manager, Translator, Billing Staff, or Accountant.
